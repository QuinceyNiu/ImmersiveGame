# **Survive the Undead Onslaught**

In the year 2035, Littleton was a picturesque small town right out of a storybook. That was until the outbreak. A virulent pathogen has ravaged the community, turning its residents into the living dead. The charming streets where children once played are now a macabre maze of zombie-infested chaos. As a lone survivor in this apocalyptic setting, your mission is to survive, adapt, and overcome.

"The Little Town" offers a gripping zombie survival experience that will test your quick thinking, agility, and tactical prowess. Arm yourself with your fists of fury, scavenge for firearms, and tread carefully—once you step into the zombie danger zone, you're in for a relentless battle against the clock and the undead.
